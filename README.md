# Simulation 🧬

This application represents step-by-step 2D simulation of a world populated by:

* **Wolves** 🐺
* **Rabbits** 🐇
* And some **obstacles** 🗻🌳🥕

## Predator 👺
Predators roam the landscape in search of prey to satisfy their hunger. Their main goal is to find and devour a rabbit. To achieve this, predators can:

- **Move**: Predators can move around the environment to search for prey.
- **Bite**: When a predator encounters a rabbit, it can attempt to bite and consume it.

## Rabbits 🐰
Rabbits spend their time foraging for food. Their primary objective is to find and eat carrots. Rabbits can:

- **Move**: Rabbits can hop around the environment to find carrots.
- **Bite**: When a rabbit finds a carrot, it can bite it to satisfy its hunger and replenish its healing points.

## Pathfinding algorithm 📏
I used BFS algorithm to find the way to the target. You can see a visualization of this algorithm in the gif below.
